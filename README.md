ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emre

Computing is pop culture. Pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like youâ€™re participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the futureâ€”itâ€™s living in the present.
//Alan Kay : Writer of Designing Data-Intensive Applications

This perspective resonates with me deeply. Iâ€™m starting from zero in the world of software development. I donâ€™t have any projects yetâ€”right now, Iâ€™m focused entirely on learning. Iâ€™m not here for fame or money. Iâ€™m here because I want to be part of something meaningfulâ€”something that shapes the future and impacts millions of people.

ðŸŽ¯ My Intention

I donâ€™t just want to write code. I want to understand where it all came from, what itâ€™s doing now, and where itâ€™s going.

ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Doing Now
	â€¢	Learning Python
	â€¢	Studying computer science fundamentals (algorithms, data structures)
	â€¢	Practicing daily with Git & GitHub
	â€¢	Building small terminal-based projects to reinforce what I learn

ðŸ§­ Notes

I donâ€™t have public projects yetâ€”but this page is my log. It marks where I started, and eventually, it will show how far Iâ€™ve come. Iâ€™ll document my journey, lessons, and reflections here.
